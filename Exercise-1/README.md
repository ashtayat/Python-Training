# Estarta Python Training

Welcome to the Estarta Python Training course! This repository contains all the materials and resources for the training. Whether you are new to programming or looking to enhance your Python skills, this course is designed to help you develop a strong foundation in Python programming.

## Course Overview

### What We Will Be Working With

- **VS Code with the Jupyter Extension**: A powerful code editor that supports Python development and interactive Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Poetry**: A tool for dependency management and packaging in Python.

#### Software Descriptions

- **VS Code**: A versatile and powerful code editor with support for extensions to enhance your development experience. The Jupyter extension allows you to create and interact with Jupyter Notebooks directly in VS Code.
- **Poetry**: Simplifies dependency management and project setup, ensuring your project is portable and reproducible. Poetry handles package installation, resolves dependencies, and creates virtual environments for your projects.
- **Jupyter**: An open-source tool that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Jupyter Notebooks are used extensively in data science, machine learning, and academic research.

### Course Topics

- **Day 1**: Introduction to Python
- **Day 2**: Functions and Modules
- **Day 3**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Part 1
- **Day 4**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Part 2
- **Day 5**: Data Structures
- **Day 6**: File Handling and Serialization
- **Day 7**: Data Handling and Analysis
- **Day 8**: Working with APIs
- **Day 9 & 10**: Final Project

Each seminar will be followed by a 3 to 4-hour practice session with exercises and recommended readings.

### Note

While we recommend using VS Code with the Jupyter extension and Poetry for environment management, you are free to use any code editor you prefer.
